* Unit circle
  - Def: A circle with a radius of 1.
  - Frequently used in trigonometry.

* 2D polygons
  - Def:

** Circle
   - Def: A closed shape in Euclidean geometry.
   - A = \pi{}r²
   - C = 2\pi{}r
   - C = \pi{}d

** Rectangle
   - Def: A quadrilateral with 4 right angles in Euclidean geometry.
   - A = lw
   - P = 2l + 2w
   - p = 2(l + w)

** Parallelogram
   - Def: A simple quadrilateral with 2 pairs of parallel sides.
   - K = bh

** Trapezoid
   - Def: A convex quadrilateral with at least 1 pair of parallel
     sides.
   - K = (a + b)/2 * h
* 3D figures
  - Def:

** Cube
   - Def:
   - V = a^3
   - A = 6a^2

** Prism
   - Def: A polyhedron with 2 identical bases, where /n/ other faces
     join the corresponding sides of the bases.
   - Volume for a right prism: A = A_b * h

** Cylinder
   - Def:
   - V = \pi{}r²h
   - A = 2\pi{}r(h + r)

** Sphere
   - Def: A perfectly round 3D object.
   - V = 4/3\pi{}r³
   - A = 4\pi{}r²

** Cone
   - Def:
   - V = 1/3A_{b}h
   - A = \pi{}r(r + \radic(r² + h²))
   - Slant height :: The distance from any point on the circle, to the
		     apex.
     - \radic(r² + h²)

** Pyramid
   - Def: A polyhedral formed by connecting a polygonal and to a point
     known as the apex.
   - V = 1/3A_{b}h
   - Slant height L = \radic(h^2 + r²)
     - /r/ is the inradius of the base
   - A = A_b + PL/2
