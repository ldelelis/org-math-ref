* Equations
  - Def: An equality between 2 expressions containing variables.
  - Solving an equation means finding the value(s) of the variable(s).   
** Quadratic equation
   - Def: Any equation given the form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
   - a, b and c are the coefficients.
   - If a = 0, the equation is linear.
   - The equation is a /second degree polynomial equation/.
   - Graphed it is called a parabola.
   - Quadratic coefficient :: Variable a.
   - Linear coefficient :: Variable b.
   - Constant :: Variable c.
     - Synonym: Free term.
*** Discriminant
    - Def: Solution by using finding the discriminant.
    - The discriminant is represented as /D/ or delta.
    - \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
    - x = (-b ± √\Delta) / (2a)
    - If \Delta > 0, the equation has to solutions.
    - If \Delta = 0, the equation has 1 solution.
    - If \Delta < 0, the equation is unsolvable.
** System of equations
   - Def: A finite set of equations, that share common solutions.
   - Synonym: Simultaneous equations
*** Substitution
    - Def: Isolate one of the variables and substitute it in another
      equation.
**** Method
     1. Solve an equation for a variable.
     2. Substitute the solved variable with the expression.
     3. Repeat until all variables have been found.
**** Example
     1. ax + by = c
	dx + ey = f
     2. x = -(by - c)/a // Solved for x
     3. d * (-(by - c)/a) + ey = f // x has been substituted
     4. y = (cd - af)/(bd - ae) // Solved for y	
*** Addition / Elimination
    - Def: Make one of the coefficients equal in both equations, to
      add or subtract them.
**** Method
     1. Make one of the coefficients for all equations equal. Multiply
        if needed.
     2. Add or subtract the equations.
     3. Solve the equation for the remaining variable.
     4. Insert the value in one of the equations and solve it.
**** Example
     1. 2x + 4y = 20
	5x + 2y = 30
     2. 10x + 4y = 60 // Multiplied by 2
     3. (2x + 4y) - (10x + 4y) = 20 - 60
     4. -8x = -40
     5. x = 5
     6. 2 * 5 + 4y = 20
     7. 4y = 10
     8. y = 5/2
*** Cramer's rule
    - Def: Solves an equation by dividing determinants of 2 matrices.
**** Method
     1. Multiply the first coefficient of the first equation by the
        second equation.
     2. Do the same, but the first coefficient of the 2nd equation.
     3. Put both right sides against each other.
     4. Isolate both expressions that contain a y.
     5. Factor y.
     6. Divide the parentheses, to solve for y.
     7. Do the same for x, but multiply with the second coefficient.
     8. Find the determinant of the equations.
     9. Find it again, but solved for x.
     10. Find it a 3rd time, but solved for y.
     11. Divide the determinant of x and y with the base determinant.
*** Gaussian elimination
    - Def: A method that utilizes matrix elementary row operations.
    - Aka row reduction.
