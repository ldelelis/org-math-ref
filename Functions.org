* Functions
  - Def: An object that takes an input and gives an output.
    - f(x) = <expression>
  - On a graph f(x) is equal to y.
  - Dependent variable :: Dependent on the independent variable (input).
  - Independent variable :: Independent of the dependent variable (output).

** Linear function
   - In calculus (and relatd): A polynomial function of degree 0 or 1.
     - y = ax + b
   - If /a/ > 1, the line grows.
   - If /a/ = 1, the line is constant.
   - If /a/ < 1, the line declines.
   - If /b/ intercepts at 0, the function is written: y = ax.
     - a \prop x
   - a = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)
   - b = y - ax
   - Slope :: Variable /a/.
   - y-intercept :: Variable /b/.
   - In linear and functional analysis: a linear function is a linear map. :todo:

** Domain
   - Def: Set of all defined inputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Range
   - Def: Set of all valid outputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Average rate of change
  - Def: The average rate of change between 2 points.
    - Δy / Δx
