* Functions
  - Def: An object that takes an input and gives an output.
    - f(x) = <expression>
  - On a graph f(x) is equal to y.
  - Dependent variable :: Dependent on the independent variable
       (input).
  - Independent variable :: Independent of the dependent variable
       (output).

** Linear function
   - In calculus (and related): A polynomial function of degree 0 or 1.
     - y = ax + b
   - If /a/ > 1, the line grows.
   - If /a/ = 1, the line is constant.
   - If /a/ < 1, the line declines.
   - If /b/ intercepts at 0, the function is written: y = ax.
     - a \prop x
   - a = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)
   - b = y - ax
   - Slope :: Variable /a/.
   - y-intercept :: Variable /b/.
   - In linear and functional analysis: a linear function is a linear
     map. // TODO linear map

** Exponential growth
   - Def: A function with a time value as its exponent.
     - f(x) = b * a^x
   - /a/ 
   - /b/ is the start value.
   - If a > 1, then /f/ has exponential growth.
   - If 0 < a < 1, then /f/ has exponential decay.

*** Calculate a and b from 2 coordinates
    - a = nroot(y_2 / y_1, x_2 - x_1)
    - b = y/a^x

** Domain
   - Def: Set of all defined inputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Range
   - Def: Set of all valid outputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Average rate of change
  - Def: The average rate of change between 2 points.
    - \Delta{}y / \Delta{}x
