* Functions
  - Def: An object that takes an input and gives an output.
    - f(x) = <expression>
  - On a graph f(x) is equal to y.
  - Dependent variable :: Dependent on the independent variable
       (input).
  - Independent variable :: Independent of the dependent variable
       (output).

** Linear function
   - In calculus (and related): A polynomial function of degree 0 or 1.
     - y = ax + b
   - If /a/ > 1, the line grows.
   - If /a/ = 1, the line is constant.
   - If /a/ < 1, the line declines.
   - If /b/ intercepts at 0, the function is written: y = ax.
     - a \prop x
   - a = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)
   - b = y - ax
   - Slope :: Variable /a/.
   - y-intercept :: Variable /b/.
   - In linear and functional analysis: a linear function is a linear map. // TODO linear map
** Exponential growth
   - Def: A function with a time value as its exponent.
     - x(t) = a * b^{t/\tau}
     - \tau is the time constant.
     - If \tau > 0 and b > 1, /x/ has exponential growth.
     - If \tau < 0 and b > 1, or \tau > 0 and 0 < b < 1, then /x/ has
       exponential decay.
** Domain
   - Def: Set of all defined inputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Range
   - Def: Set of all valid outputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Average rate of change
  - Def: The average rate of change between 2 points.
    - \Delta{}y / \Delta{}x
