* Functions
  - Def: An object that takes an input and gives an output.
    - f(x) = <expression>
  - On a graph f(x) is equal to y.
  - Dependent variable :: Dependent on the independent variable
       (input).
  - Independent variable :: Independent of the dependent variable
       (output).

** Linear function
   - In calculus (and related): A polynomial function of degree 0 or 1.
     - y = ax + b
   - If /a/ > 1, the line grows.
   - If /a/ = 1, the line is constant.
   - If /a/ < 1, the line declines.
   - If /b/ intercepts at 0, the function is written: y = ax.
     - a \prop x
   - a = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)
   - b = y - ax
   - Slope :: Variable /a/.
   - y-intercept :: Variable /b/.
   - In linear and functional analysis: a linear function is a linear
     map. // TODO linear map

** Exponential growth
   - Def: A function with a time value as its exponent.
     - f(x) = b * a^x
   - /a/
   - /b/ is the start value.
   - If a > 1, then /f/ has exponential growth.
   - If 0 < a < 1, then /f/ has exponential decay.

*** Calculate a and b from 2 coordinates
    - a = nroot(y_2 / y_1, x_2 - x_1)
    - b = y/a^x

*** Doubling time and half life
    - Def: The time required for a quantity to double or halve in
      size.
    - T_2 = log(2)/log(a)
    - T_{1/2} = log(1/2)/log(a)

** Power function
   - Def: A function which associates a value to an exponential power.
     - f(x) = b * x^a
   - /a/ changes the appearance of the function. // TODO bett. explan.
   - /b/ is the y value when x is 1.

** Differences between exponential functions and power functions
   - Exponential and power functions can look similar, but there are
     differences.
   - A exponentially growing function will start in (0,b).
   - A power function will never intercept the y-axis.
   - A power function will be a straight line in a logarithmic
     coordinate system.
   - A exponential function will be a straight line in a log-log
     coordinate system.

** Domain
   - Def: Set of all defined inputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Range
   - Def: Set of all valid outputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Average rate of change
  - Def: The average rate of change between 2 points.
    - \Delta{}y / \Delta{}x
