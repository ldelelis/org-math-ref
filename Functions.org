* Functions
  - Def: An object that takes an input and gives an output.
    - f(x) = <expression>
  - On a graph f(x) is equal to y.
  - Dependent variable :: Dependent on the independent variable
       (input).
  - Independent variable :: Independent of the dependent variable
       (output).

** Linear function
   - In calculus (and related): A polynomial function of degree 0 or 1.
     - y = ax + b
   - If /a/ > 1, the line grows.
   - If /a/ = 1, the line is constant.
   - If /a/ < 1, the line declines.
   - If /b/ intercepts at 0, the function is written: y = ax.
     - a \prop x
   - a = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)
   - b = y - ax
   - Slope :: Variable /a/.
   - y-intercept :: Variable /b/.
   - In linear and functional analysis: a linear function is a linear
     map. // TODO linear map

** Exponential growth
   - Def: A function with a time value as its exponent.
     - f(x) = b * a^x
   - /a/
   - /b/ is the start value.
   - If a > 1, then /f/ has exponential growth.
   - If 0 < a < 1, then /f/ has exponential decay.

*** Calculate a and b from 2 coordinates
    - a = nroot(y_2 / y_1, x_2 - x_1)
    - b = y/a^x

*** Doubling time and half life
    - Def: The time required for a quantity to double or halve in
      size.
    - T_2 = log(2)/log(a)
    - T_{1/2} = log(1/2)/log(a)

** Power function
   - Def: A function which associates a value to an exponential power.
     - f(x) = b * x^a
   - /a/ changes the appearance of the function. // TODO bett. explan.
   - /b/ is the y value when x is 1.
   - x = nroot(y/b, a)

*** Calculate a and b
    - a = (log(y_2) - log(y_1)) / (log(x_2) - log(x_1))
    - b = y/x^a
** Differences between exponential functions and power functions
   - Exponential and power functions can look similar, but there are
     differences.
   - A exponentially growing function will start in (0,b).
   - A power function will never intercept the y-axis.
   - A power function will be a straight line in a logarithmic
     coordinate system.
   - A exponential function will be a straight line in a log-log
     coordinate system.

** Logarithms
   - Def: The logarithm of a positive real number /x/ respecting base /b/ (b \neq 1), is
     the exponent that /b/ must be raised to result in /x/.
     - b^y = x
     - log_b(x) = y
   - Logarithms are the opposite of exponentiation.

*** Common logarithm
    - Def: A logarithm with a base of 10.
      - lg(10^x) = x
      - 10^{lg(x)} = x
    - Alt. notations: log(x), log_10(x)

*** Natural logarithm
    - Def: A logarithm with a base of Euler's number /e/.
      - ln(e^x) = x
      - e^{^ln(x)} = x
    - Alt. notations: log(x)

*** Binary logarithm
    - A logarithm with a base of 2.
      - lb(x)
    - Alt. notations: ld(x), log(x), lg(x), log_2(x)

*** Rules
    - log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)
    - log_b(x/y) = log_b(x) - log_b(y)
    - log_b(x^y) = y * log_b(x)

** Domain
   - Def: Set of all defined inputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Range
   - Def: Set of all valid outputs.
   - Related to: Naive set theory.

** Average rate of change
  - Def: The average rate of change between 2 points.
    - \Delta{}y / \Delta{}x
