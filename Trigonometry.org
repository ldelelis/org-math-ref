* Triangles
  - Def: A polygon with 3 edges and 3 vertices.
  - Notation: \triangle{}ABC
  - Angle notation: \angle{}A
  - Angle sum is 180\deg.
  - T = 1/2bh
  - Equiangular triangles :: Triangles that share the same size of
       angles.

** Equilateral triangle
   - Def: A triangle where all 3 sides are equal.
   - All angles are 60\deg.

** Isosceles triangle
   - Def: 2 of the sides are equal.
   - Legs :: The 2 equal sides.
   - Base :: The 3rd side.
   - The angle of the legs share the same size.

** Right triangle
   - Def: A triangle with an angle of 90\deg.
   - Pythagorean's theorem is defined for right triangles.
     - a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   - Hypotenuse :: The side opposite the right angle.
   - Cathesus :: One of the adjacent sides to the right angle.
     - Plural: Catheti
     - Synonym: Leg
   - Adjacent cathesus :: The side adjacent to a given angle.
   - Opposite cathesus :: The side opposite to a given angle.

** Trigonometric functions
   - Def: Functions that relate the angles to the length of the sides.
   - The unit circle can be used to define cosine, sine and tangent.

*** Sine
    - Def: The ratio between the length of the opposite and
      hypotenuse.
      - sin(\alpha) = opposite/hypotenuse

*** Cosine
    - Def: The ratio between the length of the adjacent and
      hypotenuse.
      - cos(\alpha) = adjacent/hypotenuse

*** Tangent
    - The ratio between the length of the opposite and adjacent.
      - tan(\alpha) = opposite/adjacent
      - tan(\alpha) = sin(\alpha)/cos(\alpha)
    - Angles that make cosine yield 0, are non-defined, since it's the
      denominator.
