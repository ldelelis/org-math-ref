* Differential
  - Def: The study of how functions grow or decline.
    - f'(x) = <expression>
  - ' is called prime. f' is f prime.
  - The opposite of integral.
  - Secant :: A line that touches the function in 2 points.
  - Tangent :: A line that touches the function in 1 point.
  - Continuity :: A function that can be drawn without lifting a pen.
  - Differentiability :: All points of a functions domain is
       differentiable.
** Difference quotient
   - Def: Calculates the slope of a secant line.
   - a_s = \(\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\)
   - Alt. notation: \Delta{}y/h
** Derivative
   - Def: The slope of a tangent.
     - a_t = lim_{x->0}(\Delta{}y/h)
   - Alt. notation: lim_{x->0}(a_s)
*** Derivative rules
    - Sum rule :: Method for finding the derivative of a sum of 2
                  functions.
      - f'(x) = g'(x) Â± h'(x)
      - Leibniz notation: d/dx(u + v) = du/dx + dv/dx
    - Constant rule :: A function multiplied by a constant.
      - f'(x) = cg'(x)
      - Leibniz notation: (d/dx)(c) = 0
    - Product rule :: Calculate the derivative of a product of 2
                      functions.
      - f'(x) = g'(x)h(x) + g(x)h(x)
      - Leibniz notation: (d/dx)(u * v) = u(dv/dx) + v(du/dx)
    - Chain rule ::
    - Power rule :: x^n = nx^{n-1}
    - Quotient rule :: Method for calculating the derivative of a ratio
      between 2 functions.
      - f(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / h(x)^2
** Three-step rule
   - Def: A systematic method for finding the derivative.
*** Method
    1. Find \Delta{}y
    2. Divide \Delta{}y by h to obtain the difference quotient.
    3. Calculate the limit of the difference quotient if it exists.
** Equation of a tangent
   - y = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)
** Monotonic Function
   - f'(x) > 0 \forall{}x \in [a, b] \rArr f increases
   - f'(x) < 0 \forall{}x \in [a, b] \rArr f decreases
   - f'(x) = 0 \forall{}x \in [a, b] \rArr f is constant
   - If f' is positive to the left and negative to the right, it's a maximum.
   - If f' is negative to the left and positive to the right, it's a minimum.
   - If f' has the same sign to the left and right it's a point of
     inflection.
   - To see if the function de- or increases, a number inside and
     outside the interval can be used as input for the derivative.
** Optimization
   - Def: 
* Integral
  - Def: 
    - \int_a^{b}f(x)dx = F(x)
  - The opposite of differential.
** Rules
   - Sum rule: \int{}f(x) \pm g(x)dx = \int{}f(x)dx \pm \int{}g(x)dx
   - Product w/ constant rule: \int{}c * f(x)dx = c * \int{}f(x)dx
