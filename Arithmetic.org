* Parentheses
  - The first priority in the hierarchy.
** Gange ind i parantes
   - Man bruger den distributive lov // TODO Skal researches nærmere.
   - Multiply each term in the parentheses.
     - a(b + c) = ab + ac
** Multiply 2 parentheses
   - Each number in the first, is multiplied into the other.
     - (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd
** Factorization
   - Def: The act of turning an object into factors
   - You can make 2 terms into a factor.
** Terms and parentheses
   - Parentheses containing addends can just be evaluated.
   - If they contain a minus, change the sign of every term.
* Binomial theorem
  - Def: Describes the expansion of powers of a binomial.
** Square of a binomial
  - Often used for reduction.
*** Equations
    - (a + b)² = a² + b² + 2ab
    - (a - b)² = a² + b² - 2ab
    - (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
* Fraction
  - Def: A representation of a non-whole number.
  - The denominator can't be 0.
  - Danish mnemonic: Top = Tæller, Nederst = Nævner
  - The bigger the numerator, the lower the quotient.
    - m > n, 1/m < 1/n
  - If the numerator and denominator are idential, the quotient is 1.
  - Numerator :: The number above the line.
  - Denominator :: The number below the line.
  - Quotient :: The result of a division or fraction.
  - Unit fraction :: Fraction with a numerator of 1.
** Addition and subtraction
   - To add, add add both numerators.
   - To subtract, subtract both numerators.
   - Both fractions needs to have a common denominator.
   - a/c ± b/c = (a ± b)/c
** Multiplication
   - 2 fractions: Multiply the numerators and denominators
     respectively.
     - a/b * c/d = ac/bd
   - Fraction and number: Multiply the number with the numerator.
     - a * b/c = ab/c
** Division
   - 2 fractions: Multiply with the reciprocal fraction.
     - a/b / c/d = a/b * d/c
   - Fraction and number
     - Multiply the number with the denominator.
       - a/b / c = a/bc, c ≠ 0
     - If a division of the numerator and number has a remainder of 0,
       it's also legal.
       - a/b / c = a/c/b, a mod c = 0
** Reduction and expansion
   - Reduction: Divide the numerator and denominator with the greatest
     common divisor.
   - Expansion: Multiply the numerator and denominator with a factor.
* Exponentiation
  - Def: The act of raising a quantity to the power of another.
    - b^n
  - Roots are the opposite of exponentiation.
  - Base :: The number that is multiplied by itself.
  - Exponent :: The quantity that represents the power to which a
                given number or expression is to be raised.
  - Power :: The result of an exponentiation.
** Multiplication
   - If the bases are equal, the exponents can be added.
     - a^n * a^m = a^(n+m)
   - If the exponents are equal, the bases can be multiplied.
     - a^n * b^n = (a * b)^n   
** Division
   - If the bases are equal, the exponents can be subtracted.
     - a^m/a^n = a^m-n
   - If the exponents are equal, the bases can be divided.
     - a^n/b^n = (a/b)^n
** Power of a power
   - You multiply the exponents.
     - (a^n)^m = a^{n*m}
** Exponent of 0 or 1
   - If the exponent is 1, the power is the base.
     - x^1 = x
   - If the exponent is 0, the power is 1.
     - a^0 = 1
** Negative exponents
   - If the exponent is negative, the power can be turned into a
     fraction, where the exponent is positive.
     - a^n = 1/a^n
   - If the exponent is -1, the denominator is equal to the base.
     - a⁻¹ = 1/a
** Fractional exponents
   - If the exponent is a unit fraction, it can be converted to an
     nth root.
     - x^{1/n} = nroot(x, n)
   - If the exponent is a fraction, it can be converted to an nth
     root to the power of the numerator.
     - x^{m/n} = nroot(x, n)^m
** Power of 10 (Scientific notation)
   - Def: An integer with an exponent of 10.
   - Def #2: A way of writing a very large/small number.
     - m * 10^n or 10^n
   - The exponent indicates how many zeroes that go after the 1.
   - In programming, spreadsheets and databases E notation is used.
* Roots
   - Def: A quantity multiplied by itself, that gives another
     quantity.
     - nroot(a, n)
   - A root with a degree of 2 is called a square root.
   - A root with a degree of 3 is known as a cube root.
   - Roots with a higher degree are reffered by ordinal numbers.
   - Exponentation is the opposite of roots.
   - nroot(a, n) = a^{1/n}
   - Radical :: The number having its root taken.
   - Degree :: The exponent for a root.
   - Radix :: The sign used for roots. √.
     - Also called the /radical sign/.
** Square root
   - Def: A root with a degree of 2.
     - √(x)
   - A square root to the power of 2 will cancel each other out.
     - √(x)^2 = x
   - As the square root can be rewritten to one, the exponent rules 
     apply as well.
   - An exponent of 0.5 equals the square root of the same number.
   - √a = a^{1/2}, a > 0
** Root of an exponent
   - Hvis rodeksponenten og eksponent er ens, så får man samme resultat.
   - Hvis rodeksponenten og eksponent er forskellige, kan man lave roden
     om til en potens.
   - root(a^p, q) = a^{p/q}
** Regneregler for rødder
   - Hvis man dividere eller multiplikere, kan man finde roden før man
     udfører operationen.
     - root(a * b, n) = root(a, n) * root(b, n)
     - root(a/b, n) = root(a, n)/root(b, n)
   - Hvis en brøk med nævneren, n, er en eksponent, kan den laves om
     til en brøk.
     - a^{-1/n} = 1/root(a, n), b > 0
* Properties of arithmetic
** Commutative
   - Def: An operation is commutative if order is irrelevant.
   - Noncommutative operation :: If order is relevant..
** Associative
   - Def: A group of quantities yield the same result regardless of
     their grouping.
** Distributive
   - Def: Multiplying a sum or difference with a number is the same as
     multiplying the terms.
     - x(y ± z) = xy + xz
* Prime number
  - Def: A number with no other divisors than 1 and itself.
** Prime number factorization
   - Def: A method for finding the prime factors of a number, by
     dividing with the lowest prime numbers.
   - Tip: Start with the lowest prime numbers.
* Lowest common multiple
  - Def: The lowest quantity that is a multiple of 2 or more
    quantities.
    - lcm(x, y) = z
  - Multiple :: A number divided by another without returning a
                remainder.
** Method
   1. Prime factor the 2 numbers.
   2. The common factors and the rest of the prime factors are multiplied.
   3. The result is the least common multiple.
*** Example
    1. 36 and 120.
    2. The prime factors of 36 are 2^2 * 3^2.
    3. The prime factors of 120 are 2^3 * 3 * 5.
    4. Common prime factors are 2^2, 3 and 5.
    5. 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60
    6. 60 is the lowest common multiple.
